= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin replaces the original WPML Admin Language Switcher with a new select box, perfectly positioned in the Admin Bar. Nothing more.

= Is this Plugin/Addon official from WPML? =

No, absolutly not. This plugin is not in any way connected to the WPML Core Developers. But i`d love it, if they take over my idea.
